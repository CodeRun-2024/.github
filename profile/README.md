# CodeRun 2024

This GitHub organization will be used as a submission system for [CodeRun] 2024, an IT Marathon organized by [BEST Cluj-Napoca].

Registration ended on 2024-11-05. If you didn't get to register by then, see you next year!

If you did register, get in touch so we can give you access to the organization. You will need a GitHub account, at least one per team (so you are able to submit your work). If you already have accounts, no need to make a new one! The participants responsible will have requested these from you, so we can add you to this organization.
